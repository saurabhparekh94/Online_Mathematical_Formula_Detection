# Online_Mathematical_Formula_Detection

The Project aims at classifing, Segementing and Parsing Handwritten Mathematical Formula. 
Input - The input to our Project is Handwritten Trace Points in the inkml format.

Classification - Given a set of Trace points the Prohect classifies these trace points as digits(0-9),Alphambets(a-z), symbols(+,-,=,*,=),punctions(COMMA,PERIOD) etc

Segmentation- From a given trace file the segmentation tries to identify individual trace points. 

Parsing- Parsig tries to Identify if the given symbol isto the right, top, bottom, subscript, superscript of the previous symbol.
